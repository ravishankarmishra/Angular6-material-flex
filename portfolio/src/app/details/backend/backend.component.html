      <div class="basic-intro">
          In back-end development, my current stack involves Java, WCS  and SpringBoot Framework, From MEAN stack i am very much impressed with NodeJS and wouls like to get my hands dirty with it. 
          What I can do is:
          <ul>
          <li>Integration of front-end development and back-end</li>
          <li>Development of apps using Java and SpringBoot</li>
          <li>Development of web services</li>
          <li>Refactor existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate functions and classes, splitting out the business logic from app's views and controllers</li>
        </ul>
